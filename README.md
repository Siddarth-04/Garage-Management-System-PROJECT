# 🚗 Garage Management System (Salesforce)

## 📘 Project Overview

The **Garage Management System (GMS)** is a Salesforce-based application designed to automate and streamline the daily operations of a garage.  
It manages **customer bookings, vehicle service tracking, spare parts inventory, and billing** — all from one centralized platform.

Traditional garage operations often depend on manual registers or outdated tools, which lead to inefficiencies and poor customer experience.  
This system resolves those issues by integrating **Customer**, **Vehicle**, **Service**, and **Billing** data into Salesforce CRM.

### 🔧 Key Benefits

- Improved efficiency and accuracy
